    <p>What I am about to describe in this post is probably something obvious to the
advanced Rails developer. Yet, it's sometimes hard to get the concept
when you come from other frameworks or technology.</p>

<p>I, at least, personally had a problem getting it when I first started
using Rails.</p>

<h2>REST</h2>

<p>REST stands for <em>Representational State Transfer</em>.
What does that mean anyway? well, a lot of things, but, for now, I'll
just focus on what it means when designing a Rails app.</p>

<h3>The wrong way</h3>

<p>I've seen it a lot of times. It's just easy to think that, let's say, a
OrderController, must always be tied to a Order model, and that,
all actions performed on the Order objects should be done via that controller.</p>

<p>So, with that thought on your mind, you end up with a controller like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">OrderController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">new</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">review</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">remove_review</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">cancel</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">pay</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">return_order</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<h3>What's wrong here?</h3>

<p>If you take a look at it, there's all these actions on the controller
that shouldn't be there: review, remove_review, cancel, pay,
return_order.</p>

<p>Thinking restful is thinking CRUD. Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete. It
means that you have <em>resources</em> and that with every request you are
creating, updating, deleting or retrieving for display that resource or
many of them.</p>

<p>A resource is not necesarily a model, it's just <em>something</em> that has a
state or that can be altered.</p>

<h3>How to make it right?</h3>

<p>So, if we go back to our example, the right thing to do, is to think
about those <em>bad</em> actions as a resource.</p>

<p>If you're going to review an order, then, you need a <em>OrderReview</em>
controller.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">OrderReviewController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">delete</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>See? Now we're thinking of the review as a <em>resource</em>, a resource that
can receive all the <em>CRUD</em> actions. In this specific case we <em>SHOULD</em> have
a <em>OrderReview</em> model and whatnot, but I just wanted to make an example
out of it.</p>

<p>A most common mistake... an action that actually alters the state of an
object like the cancel action.</p>

<p>I know you're, just changing some field from '<em>active</em>' to '<em>enabled</em>' or
something, but still, this looks much better:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">OrderCancellationsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">delete</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>In case you're wondering, the <em>delete</em> action would be used to cancel the
cancellation (it can happen).</p>

<p>You could now refactor all the other actions to their respective
controller: <em>PaymentsController</em>, <em>ReturnsController</em>.</p>

<h2>Associations</h2>

<p>In terms of REST, <em>everything is a resource</em>. And the best way to think
how models relate to each other is by thiking that their relationship is
a resource.</p>

<p>For example, if you had a User that can add other User objects as its
friends, instead of creating a <em>add_friend</em> or something action, you'd add
a <em>Friendship</em> controller, with <em>create</em> and <em>delete</em> actions.</p>

<p>By the way, I've seen relationships like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>

  <span class="n">has_and_belongs_to_many</span> <span class="ss">:users</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="c1"># Plus a lot of weird code to make this work</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p><em>Always remember to think restful</em>, probably the user should:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:friendships</span>
<span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:friends</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:class_name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;User&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:through</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:friendships</span>

<span class="c1"># This actually requires more code to make it work, but, you get the</span>
<span class="c1"># point, right?</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Think about it. Way better.</p>

<h3>But, why? You have to write all this "unnecesary" code</h3>

<p><em>Mantainability</em> and <em>Readability</em> mostly. If you're not thinking about
these two while writing your code, you're being rude to your collegues
or yourself.</p>

<p>Also, Rails its all about love and following conventions. This is one of
them.</p>

<p>Hope this guide helps you in some way, cheers!</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered if you can do something to make your ruby development even faster?
Are you tired of waiting for rspec to finish?
Is your rails application eating more and more memory and you have to restart your app once in a while?</p>

<p>Ok, This is one of those paths to improve your ruby dev life, nothing new, but it's very effective.</p>

<h2>What is REE?</h2>

<p>As you can read on the ruby site: "Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.... and it continues". But the most important part, as of this post, is its garbage collection technique: "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29#Na.C3.AFve_mark-and-sweep">mark-and-sweep</a>".</p>

<p>Modern requirements has pushed developers to implement and improve current techniques to recycle memory and maximize resources.</p>

<p>Ruby Enterprise Edition has come to attack this matter, replacing the garbage collector algorithm with "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">copy-on-write</a>", implementing a forking model(reducing application's memory usage by 33% on average) and the most important part (again, as of this post): the ability to <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/documentation.html#_garbage_collector_performance_tuning">tweak the garbage collector</a> via environment variables.</p>

<p>Based on the documentation and some research made by well known companies (twitter, 37signals), you can gain a lot of performance if you tweak the garbage collector settings used by ruby enterprise edition, I'll show you my own benchmark tests. Being part of a release engineering team, I need to run all tests as fast as possible, finding this technique highly effective.</p>

<h2>Installing REE</h2>

<p>I'll guide you through this post assuming that you already have <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/">rvm</a> installed on your computer.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">ecruz@ecruz-mbp:project <span class="o">(</span>master<span class="o">)</span><span class="nv">$ </span>rvm install ree

<p>Wow! I hadn't noticed the huge difference between ruby 1.8.7 and ruby enterprise edition, that was ~1.4x faster!</p>

<p>Ok, I got huge difference between two versions, the question is, can it be improved? The answer is found in REE documentation, section <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/documentation.html#_garbage_collector_performance_tuning">Garbage Collector Performance Tunning</a>. Twitter has published their production settings, let's see what we can get.</p>

<p>You should've seen my face when I came back and saw the results, that meant 2.2x faster!</p>

<p>My next thought was: I have to make this a permanent change in my system, so it was easy:</p>

<p>For all my tests, I used unicorn with 3 workers running in production mode and memcached enabled. Another huge difference is memory usage, I've seen flat, much less memory utilization and response time has been responding ~1.8x faster. You should definitively consider using this approach in your production environments.</p>

<p>*Disclaimer, this is not an extensive research about REE and it's features, it's just intended to show small tweaks that can make a huge difference in your daily development work.</p>

    <p>First off, this post is meant to be a brief introduction for testing Rails applications with RSpec, I'll only get into model and controller testing.</p>

<h2>What is RSpec?</h2>

<p>Well, it’s easy, RSpec is a framework for Ruby that allows us make scenarios for our applications and help us test them.
The main goal about testing your objects with RSpec, is that you test what your object is going to do, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behaviour Driven Development</a>. The syntax is very simple, and human readable, this way you can read it as if you were having a conversation with your client to determine what exactly they want the project to do. It’s very easy to use, as long as you know exactly what you want to test, and here is where I think most of us usually get stuck...
So, after this brief introduction, let’s get to the action!</p>

<h2>How do we start an RSpec test for our rails application?</h2>

<p>Say you already have a <em>Rails3</em> project. In your Gemfile add the next lines.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">group :development, :test <span class="k">do</span>
<span class="k">  </span>gem <span class="s2">&quot;rspec-rails&quot;</span> , <span class="s2">&quot;&gt;= 2.2.0&quot;</span>
end
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Next run the <em>bundle install</em> command in your console in order to install all your gems in the Gemfile. After the bundle is finished write in your console</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>rails generate rspec:install
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>With this generator we get the necessary files to run the specs and the directory in our app where we are going to save them.
To finish with this small setup you should run the next commands to make sure everything is running fine in your app!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>rake db:migrate
<span class="nv">$ </span>rake db:test:prepare
<span class="nv">$ </span>rake spec
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>After this, every time you generate from the console a new model or controller, RSpec will automatically create the spec file for you... Now you are more than ready to start testing!</p>

<h2>Let’s begin with Model testing</h2>

<p> <em>RSpec is all about expectations</em>. What are you expecting an object to do? That’s what you must be thinking when you start a new test.
Normally in a Model, what do you do? You basically validate the fields on your tables, or create definitions in order to get new queries, among other things.
So that’s what you must test, for this you have the following magic words: <br /></p>

<p><em>describe, context, before, it and should</em></p>

<p><em>describe</em>, as the word says, it will help you describe what you want the method to do. <br />
<em>context</em>, will help you to describe the environment or the background where your tests will be running at. <br />
<em>before</em>, will help you define stuff you need to be done before you test a method, for example, if you need to simulate an account, a shipping_cart, before is your friend. <br />
<em>it</em>, is meant to be, also, a descriptor for the situation you are testing. <br />
<em>should and should</em>_<em>not</em>, with this magic word, you will be able to compare if you’ve received what you were expecting. <em>Remember it’s all about expectations</em>.<br /></p>

<p>In the following example, we are going to test the Account Model in an application, the first step is to describe the model. Next we define the context and create some accounts in the before segment.
Now, we check that the created accounts have valid attributes, for that we created an account without an e-mail address, which we test in the second example. Finally the second context is meant to search an account by its e-mail address.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="no">Account</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">context</span> <span class="s2">&quot;when an account is created it has to have an e-mail address&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">before</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:each</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="vi">@account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create!</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:email</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;test@test.com&quot;</span>
        <span class="vi">@account2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test2&quot;</span>
      <span class="k">end</span> 
      
      <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;validates the account attributes&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="vi">@account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">be_valid</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>

      <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;doesn&#39;t validates the account attributes&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="vi">@account2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should_not</span> <span class="n">be_valid</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">context</span> <span class="s2">&quot;when an account is searched by its e-mail address&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span> 
      <span class="n">before</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:each</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="vi">@account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create!</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test Name&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:email</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;test@test.com&quot;</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>

      <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;should find the account&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
        <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;test@test.com&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="n">be_true</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<h2>...Now Controllers</h2>

<p>It’s basically the same thing as with models, the difference is that you need to simulate when you’re sending data to a method, what normally a POST, GET, PUT or DELETE request from our browser would be. This is done, for example, by typing <em>get :show, :id => @account.id</em> in our test file where we say which method we want to use (<em>:show</em>) and which parameter we want to send (<em>:id</em>).
In the next example we test the show method from our Accounts controller, let’s say we want the method to find an account by its id. We go the same way as before, we create two accounts in the before segment, then we describe the method we are testing and what it should do. In this case as our example says, it should find the account by its id. The <em>assigns[:account]</em> is what the method returns to the call. In this case the id, name and e-mail. <br />
The last example tests the <em>:new</em> method in the controller, again we <em>post</em> the name and email of the account and then we look for the registered name, if it's found then it has been successfully created.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="no">AccountsController</span> <span class="k">do</span>

  <span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;GET show&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">before</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:each</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="vi">@account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create!</span> <span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Name&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:email</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;test@test.com&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
    
    <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;should find the account by its id&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<p>To finish, I want to talk a little bit about the views, which are not often tested, at least with RSpec, if you want to get into view testing, I think it will be better for you to use <a href="https://github.com/brynary/webrat">Webrat</a>, <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> or <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>. I'll just leave this for another post.</p>
